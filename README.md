# DELE-CA2
This repository contains my work for the first assignment of the Deep Learning module at Singapore Polytechnic. The assignment is divided into two parts:
- Part A: Apply a suitable GAN architecture to the problem of image generation on the CIFAR10 dataset to create 1000 small colour images.
- Part B: Apply a suitable RL architecture to the problem. Land the [LunarLander](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/box2d/lunar_lander/) successfully on the landing pad.
